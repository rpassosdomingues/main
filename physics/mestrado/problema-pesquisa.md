## Introduction

When we study gas feedback processes in the core of active galaxies (feedback in AGNs), the main information we look for is the rate of outflow [is one of the quantdads] {the objt is to know if this outflow is consistent enough to impact the star formation process based on Eddington luminosity} (speed at which gas is being expelled from the galaxy, for unknown reasons). There is no consensus yet, but some authors suggest that the phenomenon is associated with single effects or a combination of effects, such as: winds, shock waves, and relativistic jets. The main problem lies in the estimates made for density and temperature in the calculation of outflow rates in different galaxies. [the temperature itself is not a problem...] {the temperature dictates the relevance of shock processes -- discriminator (is there a jet?)}

## Background to the problem

A reliable value of the outflow rate will bring us closer to understanding why star formation goes extinct in galaxies, at what time this occurs with respect to the age of the galaxy, or even, with respect to the history of the universe.

To make an accurate estimate, it is necessary to obtain more complete results of the density of the gas present in the narrow line regions (NLR). The density is a very difficult parameter to estimate, for several reasons, among them, in particular: the extrinsic interstellar extinction, of the observed AGN source, and intrinsic, in our Galaxy. [one part of the flux is involved by the outflow, another is not -- ambiguity between the limit of atoms per cm3 in the lines -- the major difficulty is to distinguish whether the lines are indeed affected by the outflow] {razao of lines may offer reddening results and greater indicators of denoising -- ideally a diagnosis of more often ionized lines -- argon 4 -- are very faint} -- {on IR, there are IBS lines that are sensitive to higher density ranges} -- {cross different indicators} -- {use different lines (because there is a resolution problem) to test for convergence between indicators}

One of the best ways to obtain these results is from the ratio of lines of gas emission from NLRs at given wavelengths. There are several indicators for this estimation that have not yet been explored, due to their complexity. [insufficient resolution, spectra only in Optics, ...]

## Open questions

There are in the literature, papers that have investigated small samples and few indicators for the gas density values of the (NLR) in galaxies. This work is the first attempt to study a large sample of galaxies (~ 70 -- 80) from individual spectra of NIR spectroscopy data, complemented by spectroscopy in the Optics, aiming to investigate the properties that can be attributed to AGNs, such as: (i) the extinction affecting nuclear and extended emission gas, (ii) the kinematics of the narrow line region (NLR) and (iii) the physical properties and conditions of this gas. Crossing different indicators, performing various diagnostics.

## Proposed methodology to answer the open questions

Do data reduction (maybe not need) and a refined statistical treatment of the spectra, fitting Gaussian components in order to obtain FWHM values, calculate emission line ratios, from the flux ratio, to finally obtain more accurate values of density and temperature of the NLR outflow. [We intend to use such indicators as: (i) for extinction [NGC 4388] (ii) for density (iii) SII, OII, SIII, for temperature]

## Challenges

Some emission lines suffer more from the influence of interstellar extinction than others. It is not our intention to exclude these lines, as they are important links that will reveal what we are looking for. Therefore, we need to analyze various indicators ("atomic characteristic of the lines") in -comparison-- with extinction maps. [There will be no comparison with intrinsic extinction maps on the object, this is determined by atomic physics].

- Good quality spectrum
- Good spectral resolution
- Low S/N
- As many region-sensitive lines as possible for proper diagnosis

## Strategies and upper bound of approximations

We assume that the dust properties, of the observed galaxy with respect to our galaxy, are similar (uniform in both distribution and composition). We assume that the extinction in the observed galaxy is the same as the extinction in our galaxy [with respect to dust]. Ultimately we have to deal with an extinction law due to the Galaxy.

Since extinction laws are a function of Galactic latitude, objects from the Galactic north and south poles will be prioritized in our sample of galaxies, so we can mitigate the effects of intrinsic extinction.

To accomplish the first goal, we will perform a comparison of a variety of extinction diagnostics based on allowed and forbidden lines, we will use lines that are already used, but not isolated. This will allow us to make a detailed map of the dust distribution on each of the objects. 

For the second goal, we will perform a detailed comparison of the emission line profiles in both optical and NIR, which will allow us to state whether a hidden region of broad lines is indeed present in the spectrum of the objects.

For the third goal, the ratios of the temperature- and density-sensitive lines will be used to more reliably determine the ionization structure of the gas and the physical conditions of the gas in emitting galaxies.

## Expected Results

Obtain a more reliable measure of the density of the outflow gas (to calculate power of the otflow gas and at the same time see, in general, whether the conditions show correlation or anticorrelation).

Is there a density law for outflow rates?

If there is, what developments might this result have with respect to the results of outflow rates in AGN feedback?

Will our results provide new links to cosmological constants?
