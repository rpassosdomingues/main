  Here I have developed a project to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a patient
  and inform their classification.

  BMI, body mass index; WHO, World Health Organization.
  WHO 1998 classification of BMI categories for Europids

  bmi = weight/(pow(height,2));  // Body Mass Index (BMI)
                                 // The pow(height, 2) function squares the value
                                 // stored in &height.

    cout << "\n\t You are underweight." << endl;
  }else if (bmi > 18.5 && bmi <= 24.9){             // if 18.5 <= bmi <= 24.9
